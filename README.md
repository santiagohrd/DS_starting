# Overview

This project serves as an introduction to the fundamental steps of data science, focusing on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing using the popular Ames Housing Dataset (train.csv).

The primary objective of this phase is to understand the relationships between various housing features (like square footage, quality, and location) and the final sale price, while also cleaning the data to prepare it for machine learning model training.
